	 <h2>Continuous Integration in the Cloud with Circle CI</h2>
	 <div class="align-justify"><p>Continuous integration and deployment are awesome. Why put off until tomorrow what you can do right now as part of your workflow, saving yourself a massive headache later?</p>

 <p>However, there are costs. Build servers and build agents, manual or automated provisioning (perhaps using Puppet or Chef), configuration for these tools, agent configuration drift, and more. None of these compare to the risk and headache of large integrations and big releases, but what if you could avoid all that while also avoiding tedious configuration? Enter Circle CI.</p>

 <p>A proliferation of cloud services means it is possible to outsource the complexity of continuous integration and deployment, allowing you and your team to focus on building applications. While there are several tools in this space, such as Travis CI and Semaphore, I will focus Circle CI, which we currently use on my team at Sky.</p>

 <p>It&#8217;s past time to dive right on in....</div>
